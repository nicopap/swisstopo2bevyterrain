# WARNING: bevy_terrain doesn't support the high precision dataset (10cm/50cm)
# because it relies on attachment scale being the same as the base height scale.
# You'll get two CSV files. Each line represents an image URL to download,
# to download everything automatically, run the following command:

# How many images to download at the same time. Please only use this with the

# As of writing, the file name structure of each image is:
# <PROJECT_NAME>_<YEAR>_<CH1903+ COORD>_<PRECISION>.tif
# Where
# - <PROJECT_NAME> is 'swissalti3d' or 'swissimage-dop10'
# - <YEAR> is when the picture was taken
# - <CH1903+ COORD> is the coordinate of the picture encoded in the Swiss
#   national measure system, at kilometer scale, two values separated by a
#   '-', first value is east/west and second north/south
#   https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/knowledge-facts/surveying-geodesy/coordinates/swiss-coordinates.html
# - <PRECISION> two or three values I'm not sure how to interpret.

# bevy_terrain "attachment" and "height" data must be presented as
# <filename>_<x>_<y>.<fmt>, so we need to transform those values.

# Get min values in CH1903 coords
# We assumet albedo and topo data both have the same set of images.

# bevy_terrain accepts heights in the form of 16 bits integer, the swisstopo
# alti3d is 32 bits floats. We need to convert them. Currently the tiff crate
# is too limited, it can't read the swissimage-dop10 images because it is
# encoded in YCbCr. I converted the files using the `tiff2rgba` utility, now
# the tiff crate can read it
# NOTE: The lowest point in Switzerland is 193m in lake maggiore, while the
# highest point is 4634mÂ±10m at Pointe Dufour
